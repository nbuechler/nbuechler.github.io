This project is page that encourages users to view my main web page: http://www.nathanielbuechler.com

# Purpose
This is a GitHub page, and it has simple, somewhat silly content to encourage users to navigate to my main web page.

# Lessons Learned
* Making a GitHub page is very easy, and is a must for every GitHub account.
* In my case, I tried to think back to my graphic design background to emphasize different content of the single HTML page, and I'm fairly satisfied with the result. Layout and font-size can make a huge impact on the end result. (2016)
